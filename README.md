# React MUI App

This project is a demonstration of how to build a responsive and customizable UI using **Material UI (MUI)** in a React application.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to explore and practice working with a wide range of MUI components. It is not focused on business logic or advanced features, but rather on learning how to effectively use MUI to create a well-structured and styled application.

## Features

- **Theming**: Custom light and dark mode toggle with personalized colors.
- **Drawer & AppBar**: Responsive layout with a permanent drawer on desktop and temporary drawer on mobile.
- **Grid Layout**: Used to structure the layout responsively.
- **Table**: Displaying a list of tasks using MUI's `Table` component.
- **Forms**: Including customized `TextField`, `Select`, and `Autocomplete` components.
- **Validation**: Basic form validation using MUI props like `required`.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses `theme.breakpoints` to adjust layout for different screen sizes.
